# Introduction to Linear Regression

Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm that is used to predict the value of a continuous variable. Linear regression is a simple algorithm that is easy to understand and implement. Linear regression is often used as a baseline algorithm to compare the performance of more complex algorithms.

## Generating synthetic data for experiments

Given a data set with pairs of input feature vector and output value(s), a regression model can be learned. There are different regression models that you can try, including linear regression, ridge Regression, etc.

Let us consider the simplest form of a linear regression model (i.e., fitting a straight line to one-dimensional input data). This simple model can be extended to model more complicated data behavior.

We will start with the most familiar linear regression, a straight-line fit to data. A straight-line fit is a model of the form $y = θ1x + θ0$ where $θ1$ is commonly known as the slope, and 
$θ0$ is commonly known as the intercept (also known as bias).

Consider the following data which is generated by scattering about a line with a slope of 2 and an intercept of -5 with some random fluctuations. We will use Orange to generate synthetic data for experiments. Orange provides a number of data generators that can be used to generate synthetic data for experiments. The following code snippet shows how to generate a dataset with 100 instances and 2 features using the `Python Script` widget:

```python
import numpy as np
from Orange.data import Table, Domain, ContinuousVariable, DiscreteVariable

domain = Domain([ContinuousVariable("x"),
                 ContinuousVariable("y")])

rng = np.random.RandomState(1)
x = 10 * rng.rand(50)          # randomly generated input x
y = 2 * x - 5 + rng.randn(50)  # use theta_1*x + theta_0 + noise to generated output y

arr = list(zip(x, y))
out_data = Table.from_numpy(domain, arr)
```

The code above creates a table with two columns: `x` and `y`.

## Transforming data to features and target

The first step in building a regression model is to transform the data into features and target. The features are the input variables that are used to predict the target variable. The target variable is the variable that we want to predict. In the case of linear regression, the features are the input variables and the target is the output variable.

Let's use the `Select Columns` widget to select the `x` and `y` columns as features and target, respectively. The `Select Columns` widget can be found in the `Data` category. The `Select Columns` widget allows users to select column by name or by index. The `Select Columns` widget outputs a data table with the selected columns.

## Visualizing data

Before building a regression model, it is a good idea to visualize the data. The `Scatter Plot` widget can be used to visualize the data. The `Scatter Plot` widget can be found in the `Visualize` category. The `Scatter Plot` widget displays a scatter plot of the input data. The `Scatter Plot` widget can be used to visualize the relationship between the input variables and the target variable.

## Apply linear regression

The `Linear Regression` widget can be found in the `Regression` category. The `Linear Regression` widget learns a linear regression model from the input data. The `Linear Regression` widget outputs a model that can be used to predict the target variable.

In order to see the result coefficients, we can connect the `Linear Regression` widget to the `Data Table` widget. The `Data Table` widget can be found in the `Data` category. The `Data Table` widget displays the input data in a tabular format. The `Data Table` widget can be used to inspect the input data and the output data.

## Drawing regression line on the scatter plot

To draw the regression line on the scatter plot, we can update the `Scatter Plot` widget to show the regression line. Please check the `Show regression line` checkbox in the `Scatter Plot` widget.
