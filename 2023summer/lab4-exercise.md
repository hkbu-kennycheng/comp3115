# COMP3115: Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization

## Lab 4 Excercise: Data Visualization in Orange

Please answer the following questions based on the data visualization results in Orange in Module's submission box and upload your Orange ows file.

### Q1. Load the `data.csv` into Orange and visualize the data using `Distribution`. Show the distribution of each feature (i.e. column) using histograms.

### Q2. Use `Box Plot` to compare the distributions of these five features. Answer the following questions based on the generated figure.

#### Which feature has the maximum median?

#### Which features contain outliers based on 1.5*IQR rule?


### Q3. By looking at `Distribution` to determine which features are from normal distribution and which features are from uniform distribution. Write down your answers based on the generated figures.

#### 3.1 Features from normal distribution:

#### 3.2 Features from uniform distribution:

### Q4. Use `Scatter Plot` to explore the pair-wise relationships among these five features. Answer the following questions based the generated figures.

#### 4.1 Which feature pairs are positively correlated?

#### 4.2 Which feature pairs are negatively correlated?
